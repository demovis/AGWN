We split the PeMS08 traffic sensor nodes by the county code information from the CalTrans, where the county code is the unique number that identifies the county that contains this census station within PeMS. In our experiment, we identified two counties (county number 65 and 71) in PeMS08 area. Therefore, the original PeMS08 dataset is split into two sub-dataset representing county number 65 and 71, respectively.
